## metalcloud-cli firmware-binary delete

Delete a firmware binary permanently

### Synopsis

Delete a firmware binary permanently.

This command removes a firmware binary registration from the system. This action is irreversible
and will delete all associated metadata and references to the binary file.

Note: This command only removes the binary registration from the system database. If the firmware
binary file is stored externally (e.g., on a remote repository), the actual file will not be
deleted and must be removed separately if needed.

Arguments:
  firmware_binary_id    The numeric ID of the firmware binary to delete

Examples:
  metalcloud-cli firmware-binary delete 67890
  metalcloud-cli fw-binary rm 12345
  metalcloud-cli firmware-bin delete 98765
