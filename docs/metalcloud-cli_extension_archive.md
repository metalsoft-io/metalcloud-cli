## metalcloud-cli extension archive

Deactivate published extension and make it unavailable

### Synopsis

Deactivate a published extension making it unavailable for use across the platform.

This command archives an active extension, changing its status from active to archived.
Archived extensions are no longer available for use in workflows, applications, and
actions, but their definitions and history are preserved.

Archiving is useful when you want to retire an extension without permanently deleting
it. Archived extensions can be viewed but cannot be used or modified. To reactivate
an archived extension, you must create a new version.

Arguments:
  extension_id_or_label    The unique ID or label of the active extension to archive

Requirements:
- Extension must be in active status
- User must have write permissions for extensions
- Extension should not be actively used in critical workflows

Examples:
  # Archive extension by ID
  metalcloud extension archive 12345
  
  # Archive extension by label
  metalcloud extension archive deprecated-workflow-v1

```
metalcloud-cli extension archive extension_id_or_label [flags]
```
