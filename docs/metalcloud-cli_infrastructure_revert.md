## metalcloud-cli infrastructure revert

Revert infrastructure to the last deployed state

### Synopsis

Revert an infrastructure to its last successfully deployed state, discarding all 
pending changes.

This command is useful when you want to undo configuration changes that haven't been 
deployed yet, or when you need to roll back to a known working state. All pending 
modifications to compute instances, drives, and networks will be reverted.

Note: This operation only affects the infrastructure configuration and does not 
modify any deployed physical resources. To apply the reverted configuration to 
physical resources, you need to deploy the infrastructure after reverting.

Arguments:
  infrastructure_id_or_label  The ID (numeric) or label (string) of the infrastructure to revert

Examples:
  # Revert infrastructure by ID
  metalcloud-cli infrastructure revert 123

  # Revert infrastructure by label
  metalcloud-cli infrastructure revert "web-cluster"

  # Using the alias
  metalcloud-cli infrastructure undo production-env

```
metalcloud-cli infrastructure revert infrastructure_id_or_label [flags]
```
