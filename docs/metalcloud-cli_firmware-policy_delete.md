## metalcloud-cli firmware-policy delete

Delete a firmware upgrade policy permanently

### Synopsis

Delete a firmware upgrade policy permanently from the system.

This command removes a firmware policy and all its associated configuration
including rules and server instance group associations. This action cannot
be undone and will stop any automated firmware upgrades controlled by this policy.

Required arguments:
  policy_id               The unique identifier (numeric ID) of the firmware policy

Warning: This action is irreversible. Make sure you no longer need the policy
before deleting it. Consider getting a backup of the policy configuration first
using the 'get' command.

Examples:
  # Delete firmware policy with ID 123
  metalcloud-cli firmware-policy delete 123
  
  # Delete policy using alias
  metalcloud-cli fw-policy rm 456
  
  # Get policy details before deletion (recommended)
  metalcloud-cli firmware-policy get 123
  metalcloud-cli firmware-policy delete 123
